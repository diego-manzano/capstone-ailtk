      "Okay, so you enjoy your coffee black, prefer a medium roast, usually use a pour over method, and love a nutty flavor profile. Excellent choices! I have a few recommendations that I think you'll absolutely adore.\n",
      "\n",
      "**1. Sumatra Mandheling:** This Indonesian coffee is known for its full body and complex flavor profile. It has a rich, earthy aroma with notes of dark chocolate, cedar, and of course, hazelnut. It's a classic choice for pour over and its medium roast allows the nutty nuances to truly shine.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Brewing Tip:**  For pour over, use a medium-fine grind and water heated to 200-205°F. A gooseneck kettle will give you the best control over your pour.\n",
      "\n",
      "**2. Brazil Yellow Bourbon:** This particular variety from Brazil offers a sweet, nutty flavor with hints of caramel and chocolate. It's a very balanced and approachable coffee that works beautifully with the pour over method. Its medium roast preserves its natural sweetness while highlighting the nutty undertones.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Brewing Tip:** A medium grind and water temperature of around 205°F will bring out the best in this coffee when using a pour over.  Bloom the grounds for 30 seconds before continuing your pour.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "**3. Guatemala Antigua:** While not strictly known for being intensely nutty, Guatemala Antigua offers a nuanced cup with notes of chocolate, caramel, and subtle nuttiness often described as almond or pecan.  Its balanced profile and medium body make it a delightful choice for pour over.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Brewing Tip:**  Use a medium-fine grind and 200°F water.  Try a pulse pouring technique to ensure even extraction.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "**Food Pairing Suggestion:**  A slice of pecan pie or some biscotti would pair perfectly with the nutty notes of these coffees.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Fun Coffee Fact:** Did you know that the \"peaberry\" coffee bean is a natural mutation where only one bean develops inside the cherry instead of the usual two? Peaberries are often considered to have a more concentrated flavor.\n",
      "\n",
      "I'm confident you'll enjoy one of these selections.  Let me know if you'd like to explore other options, perhaps venturing into a different region or trying a slightly darker roast with similar flavor profiles.  I'm here to help you on your coffee journey!\n",

      "That sounds delicious!  A dark roast espresso with chocolate and rich flavors is a classic. Based on your preferences and our current offerings, I have a couple of recommendations for you:\n",
      "\n",
      "**1. \"Sweety\" Espresso Blend:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Description:**  Evaluated as espresso. Sweet-toned, deeply rich, chocolaty. Vanilla paste, dark chocolate, narcissus, pink grapefruit zest, black cherry in aroma and cup. Plush, syrupy mouthfeel; resonant, flavor-saturated finish.\n",
      "* **Origin:** Panama\n",
      "* **Roast:** Medium-Light (While not a dark roast, the flavor profile is intensely rich and chocolatey, which aligns with your preference.  The lighter roast may offer a brighter acidity to balance the sweetness.)\n",
      "* **Why it fits:** This blend hits all your keywords: espresso, chocolate, and rich. The notes of vanilla and black cherry add complexity and depth, while the grapefruit zest provides a subtle brightness.\n",
      "\n",
      "**2.  A \"Custom Dark Roast\" Recommendation:**\n",
      "\n",
      "Since our current single-origin selection doesn't have a true dark roast espresso bean with a chocolatey profile, I would recommend inquiring about custom roasting options.  Many roasters, including those we work with, can create a bespoke dark roast blend tailored to your exact specifications.  Let us know if you'd like to explore this further, and we can connect you with a roaster.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Brewing Tips for Dark Roast Espresso:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Grind Size:** Fine, like table salt.\n",
      "* **Water Temperature:** 195-205°F (90-96°C).\n",
      "* **Tamping Pressure:** Consistent, around 30 lbs.\n",
      "* **Extraction Time:** 25-30 seconds.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Food Pairing Suggestions:**\n",
      "\n",
      "Dark chocolate, obviously!  But also consider:\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Desserts:** Flourless chocolate cake, brownies, biscotti.\n",
      "* **Cheese:**  A strong, aged cheddar or a creamy blue cheese.\n",
      "* **Nuts:**  Almonds, hazelnuts, or pecans.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Interesting Coffee Fact:**\n",
      "\n",
      "Did you know that the \"crema\" on top of a well-pulled espresso shot is created by the emulsification of oils and coffee solids?  It's a sign of a quality espresso and contributes to the rich, velvety texture.\n",
