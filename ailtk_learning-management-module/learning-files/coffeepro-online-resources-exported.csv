Haribo V60 Dripper,"Step-by-step brewing instructions, tips for achieving optimal flavor",https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PUufsQ-nBgQ,Video,"Make your perfect cup of coffee using an Erlenmeyer funnel and an Erlenmeyer flask used in a chemistry lab! HARIO was established in 1921 as a manufacturer and seller of scientific products. The origin of “V60” started as brewing coffee using a familiar Erlenmeyer funnel and filter paper folded into quarters found in the company. Realizing that the conical shape (parabola of Y = X2) is the most natural and effective shape for filtration, the personal cone-shaped “Coffee Madness Era” dripper was released in 1980. The current ""V60 Transparent Dripper"" was created to evolve this shape to easily reproduce the flavor of cloth drip coffee using a paper filter.

The name ""V60"" comes from the V-shape of the conical dripper with a 60° angle.

Cloth drip coffee became popular throughout Europe around 1763. The V60 resembles the shape of the cloth drip, which has a long-established history.

Cone shape
The V60 Dripper has a cone shape. The V60 Dripper allows for a deeper layer of coffee grounds than conventional fan-shaped drippers, with water flowing towards the center. This facilitates longer contact between the coffee grounds and hot water and a more thorough extraction.

Large Single Hole
One large opening allows for extraction similar to a cloth drip, without restriction on the poured water by the dripper. You can change the taste of your coffee by adjusting the rate at which you pour the hot water, allowing you to enjoy your coffee as you like it.

Spiral Ribs
The ribs (bumps) inside the dripper stretch up to the top to create a space between the paper and the dripper, allowing air to escape without hindering the expansion of coffee grounds caused by their “steaming.” Designed to maximize the flavor of coffee.


The V60 dripper has a structure that allows even those who seek a light taste or prefer a softer bitterness to enjoy their coffee.

Pour quickly for a smooth taste, or pour slowly for a richer taste. It is also easy to adjust the taste of your coffee by adjusting the extraction speed.

Preparation and ratios

Preparation and ratios
Step. 1


Fold the zippered part of the paper filter and set the filter snugly inside the dripper.

Step. 2


Set the dripper onto the server and pour hot water over the entire paper filter to warm the device and remove any odor from the paper filter. Dispose of any hot water poured into the server.

Step. 3


Put an adequate amount of ground coffee into the dripper to make the desired cups of coffee, shake gently to flatten it, and then place the dripper onto the server.

Step. 4


Pour twice as much hot water as the amount of coffee, starting slowly from the center until the entire ground coffee is soaked, and wait for 30 seconds.

Step. 5


Divide the pouring of hot water into 3 parts. (Amount of hot water per pour = 4 times the amount of ground coffee) Pour hot water in a spiral shape from the center, avoiding pouring directly onto the paper filter. The brewing time should be within 3 minutes, regardless of the number of cups.

Step. 6


Brewing is complete when all the hot water poured into the dripper has fallen into the server.

200g water (brought to a boil and used immediately)
Put the filter into the cap. Don't rinse or preheat the brewer (it doesn't make any difference)
Put coffee into the brewer
Place on scales and then add water, aiming to wet all the coffee during pouring
Start a timer, and immediately place the piston piece into the top of the brewer, about 1cm in
Wait 2 minutes
Holding the brewer and the piston, gently swirl the brewer
Wait 30 seconds
Press gently all the way

Moka Pot,James Hoffman's Ultimate Moka Pot Technique,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BfDLoIvb0w4,Video,"Constants:
1. Boiling water in the boiler
2. Full basket of coffee
3. Avoid sputtering phase by cooling down the chamber under cold water

Variables:
1. The lighter the roast, the finer the ground.
2. Less filled boiler will brew a bit earlier. Usually, dark roasts -> a bit less water, light roasts -> full boiler
3. Preheat the hob/relatively low heat on the gas hob
4. As soon as the liquid starts to flow, turn off the heat. For electric hobs, move it to the edge of the hob.

Troubleshooting:
If the sputtering phase starts before you think it's time (not enough coffee out etc):
1. Too fine of a grind 
2. Too much heat"

Guide to Coffee Grinders,James Hoffman's pros and cons of different grinder types ,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bgjvLQu5NlE,Video,"There are two main types of coffee grinders:

Burr grinders: These grinders use two burrs to grind coffee beans, providing a more consistent and even grind size. They are generally considered superior for home brewing and professional use.
Blade grinders: These grinders use a rotating blade to chop coffee beans. While they are less expensive, they tend to produce a less consistent grind and can overheat the beans, affecting the flavor.
Factors to Consider When Choosing a Coffee Grinder
Grind size: The grind size should be adjusted based on the brewing method you're using. For example, espresso requires a fine grind, while French press requires a coarse grind.
Grind consistency: A consistent grind size is essential for optimal flavor extraction. Burr grinders are better at producing consistent grinds.
Durability: A good coffee grinder should be durable and built to last. Look for grinders made with high-quality materials.
Ease of use: Consider how easy the grinder is to clean, adjust, and operate.
Noise level: If you're sensitive to noise, look for a grinder that is quiet."
Coffee Beans ,Understanding different roast levels and their impact on flavor,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6BJVM5tvnw ,Video,"Coffee Roasting
Coffee roasting is a crucial process that transforms raw coffee beans into the flavorful product we enjoy. During roasting, the beans undergo a series of chemical reactions that develop their aroma, flavor, and color.

Key Factors in Coffee Roasting:

Temperature: The temperature at which the beans are roasted determines the final flavor profile. Higher temperatures produce darker roasts with a more intense flavor, while lower temperatures result in lighter roasts with a more delicate taste.
Time: The length of time the beans are roasted also affects the flavor. Longer roasting times can lead to a more developed flavor.
Environment: Factors like humidity and airflow can influence the roasting process and the final quality of the coffee.
Common Roast Levels:

Light roast: Light-roasted beans have a light brown color and a mild, acidic flavor with floral or fruity notes.
Medium roast: Medium-roasted beans are a medium brown color and have a balanced flavor with a hint of sweetness.
Dark roast: Dark-roasted beans are dark brown or nearly black and have a strong, bold flavor with a smoky or bittersweet taste."
