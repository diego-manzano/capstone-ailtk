      "Okay, so you enjoy your coffee black, prefer a medium roast, typically use a pour-over method, and love a nutty flavor profile.  Excellent choices! I have a few recommendations that I think you'll really appreciate.\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Sumatra Mandheling:** This Indonesian coffee is known for its full body, smooth, earthy flavors, and often exhibits notes of chocolate and spice, which complement the nuttiness you enjoy. Its medium roast level is perfect for pour-over, allowing its complex flavors to shine through.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Brazilian Santos:** A classic choice, Brazilian Santos offers a balanced cup with a mild acidity and nutty, chocolaty notes.  It's incredibly versatile and works beautifully with the pour-over method, producing a clean, satisfying brew.  It's a great everyday coffee.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Guatemala Antigua:** While known for its chocolate and cocoa notes, Guatemala Antigua also often displays a subtle nuttiness, particularly when medium roasted. It has a bright acidity that adds a pleasant complexity to the cup, making it another excellent choice for pour-over.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "For your pour-over method with these medium roasts, I recommend using a medium-fine grind, similar to coarse sand.  The ideal water temperature is between 195-205°F (90-96°C).  Be sure to bloom your grounds by pouring just enough water to saturate them and letting them sit for 30 seconds before continuing the pour. This allows the coffee to degas and enhances the flavor extraction.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "As a fun coffee fact, did you know that the pour-over method, also known as hand-brewing, originated in Germany in the early 1900s? It has experienced a resurgence in popularity recently due to its ability to highlight the nuanced flavors of specialty coffees.\n",
      "\n",
      "For a delicious pairing with these coffees, consider biscotti, almond croissants, or a slice of pecan pie.  The nutty and slightly sweet flavors of these treats will complement the coffee beautifully.\n",
      "\n",
      "If you have any more questions or want to explore other options, feel free to ask!  I'm happy to help you navigate the world of coffee.\n",

      "That sounds delicious!  A dark roast espresso with chocolate and rich flavors is a classic for a reason. Based on your preferences and our current offerings, I recommend the following:\n",
      "\n",
      "**1. \"Sweety\" Espresso Blend:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Description:**  While labeled a medium-light roast, the tasting notes of this blend lean towards those richer, darker flavors you love. Expect pronounced notes of vanilla paste, dark chocolate, and black cherry, complemented by hints of pink grapefruit zest and narcissus. It offers a plush, syrupy mouthfeel and a flavor-saturated finish. Interestingly, adding milk intensifies the chocolate tones, making it even more decadent.\n",
      "* **Origin:** Panama\n",
      "* **Why it fits:** The \"Sweety\" blend, despite its name, delivers a complex and rich profile that aligns perfectly with your preference for dark chocolate and deep flavors. While not strictly a dark roast, its flavor profile mimics the richness you seek.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Brewing Tips:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Grind Size:** Fine, like table salt\n",
      "* **Water Temperature:** 195-205°F (90-96°C)\n",
      "* **Method:** Espresso machine.  Ensure your machine is properly calibrated for optimal extraction.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Food Pairing:** A slice of dense chocolate cake or a rich, dark chocolate truffle would complement this blend beautifully.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "**2.  A \"Mock Dark Roast\" Option -  Lekali (Nepal)**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Description:** This medium roast offers a unique savory-sweet profile. While not a dark roast, it features notes of dark chocolate and almond alongside sandalwood and tamari, creating a surprisingly rich and complex cup.  The crisp, satiny mouthfeel adds another layer of enjoyment.\n",
      "* **Origin:** Bhirkune Village, Nepal\n",
      "* **Why it fits:** Though not a true dark roast, the Lekali offers a depth of flavor and notes of dark chocolate that might satisfy your craving while introducing you to new and exciting flavor combinations.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Brewing Tips (for Espresso-like intensity with a Moka Pot):**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Grind Size:**  Fine, but slightly coarser than for espresso\n",
      "* **Water Temperature:** Use hot, but not boiling, water in the bottom chamber.\n",
      "* **Method:** A Moka pot can create a concentrated, intense brew that approximates espresso when using a medium roast.\n",
