      "Okay, so you prefer a medium roast, enjoy a bit of milk with your coffee, typically use a pour-over method, and love a nutty flavor profile.  Excellent choices! Let me suggest a few coffees for you.\n",
      "\n",
      "**1. Sumatra Mandheling:** This Indonesian coffee is known for its full body and smooth, earthy flavors.  It has a prominent nutty profile, often with notes of cedar and spice, which complement milk beautifully.  The medium roast brings out the sweetness while retaining the complexity. It's perfect for pour-over, allowing the nuanced flavors to shine through.\n",
      "\n",
      "**2. Brazil Cerrado:**  A classic choice, Brazilian Cerrado coffees are known for their nutty and chocolatey notes, often with a hint of caramel.  They have a balanced flavor profile and a creamy body that works well with milk.  A medium roast enhances the sweetness and nuttiness, making it a delightful choice for your pour-over.\n",
      "\n",
      "**3. Ethiopian Yirgacheffe (Medium Roast):** While typically known for its bright acidity and floral notes in lighter roasts, a medium roast Yirgacheffe develops richer, nuttier undertones alongside chocolate and caramel, making it surprisingly suitable for your preference. It retains a smooth body that pairs well with milk.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "For your pour-over method, I recommend a medium-fine grind.  Aim for a water temperature around 200-205°F (93-96°C). A gooseneck kettle will give you the best control over your pour.  Start with a bloom, pouring just enough water to saturate the grounds and letting it sit for 30 seconds. Then slowly and steadily pour the remaining water in a circular motion.\n",
      "\n",
      "A fun fact: Did you know that coffee beans are actually the seeds of a fruit, often called a coffee cherry?\n",
      "\n",
      "As for food pairings, the nutty notes in these coffees pair wonderfully with almond croissants, biscotti, or even a slice of pecan pie.  Savory options like a mushroom and swiss quiche would also complement the earthy undertones.\n",
      "\n",
      "Let me know if you have any other questions or if you'd like to explore other options!\n",

      "**1. \"Sweety\" Espresso Blend:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Description:** Evaluated as espresso. Sweet-toned, deeply rich, chocolaty. Vanilla paste, dark chocolate, narcissus, pink grapefruit zest, black cherry in aroma and cup. Plush, syrupy mouthfeel; resonant, flavor-saturated finish. In three parts milk, rich chocolate tones intensify, along with intimations of vanilla paste and black cherry in the short finish and floral-toned citrus zest in the long.\n",
      "* **Origin:** Panama\n",
      "* **Roast:** Medium-Light (While not strictly a dark roast, the \"Sweety\" blend offers deep, rich chocolate notes you'll likely enjoy.  It's a great example of how a lighter roast can still deliver intense flavor complexity.)\n",
      "* **Why it fits:** This blend emphasizes the chocolate and richness you crave, with a delightful complexity from the vanilla, fruit, and cherry notes.\n",
      "\n",
      "**2.  A Note About Dark Roasts and Espresso:**  While you specified dark roast,  extremely dark roasts can sometimes present challenges when brewing espresso. They can produce a thin, bitter shot due to the breakdown of sugars and oils during the roasting process.  The \"Sweety\" blend offers a balance – substantial chocolate notes with the proper roast level for optimal espresso brewing.  \n",
      "\n",
      "**Brewing Tips for Espresso:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Grind Size:** Fine, like table salt.\n",
      "* **Water Temperature:** 195-205°F (90-96°C).\n",
      "* **Tamping Pressure:** Consistent, around 30 lbs.\n",
      "* **Extraction Time:** 25-30 seconds.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Food Pairing Suggestions:**\n",
      "\n",
      "* **Dark chocolate:** A classic pairing that enhances the chocolate notes of the coffee.\n",
      "* **Biscotti:** The crunchy texture complements the syrupy mouthfeel of the espresso.\n",
      "* **Flourless chocolate cake:** The rich, dense cake complements the intensity of the coffee.\n",
      "\n",
      "\n",
      "**Fun Coffee Fact:** Did you know that the origin of espresso can be traced back to Italy in the early 1900s?  It was born out of a desire for a quicker way to make coffee.\n",
