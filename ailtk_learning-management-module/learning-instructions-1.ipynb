    "While it can easily be overshadowed by the allure of cutting-edge advancements, understanding and defining the problem remains crucial for the success of AI developments. Many AI projects fail because stakeholders struggle to articulate the problem clearly or effectively communicate it to technical teams. <a href=\"https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RRA2680-1.html#:~:text=Key%20Findings,solved%20using%20AI.\" target=\"_blank\">A study</a>, which analyzed insights from 65 experienced data scientists and engineers, highlights this as one of the main reasons for AI project failuresudy identified the primary root cause as a fundamental misunderstanding or miscommunication of the problem to be solved using AI. \n",
