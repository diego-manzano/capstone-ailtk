    "Evaluating models on use cases involves assessing the performance of AI models in real-world scenarios to ensure they meet the specific needs and expectations of the application. This process includes testing the modelâ€™s ability to generate accurate, relevant, and useful responses across different user inputs, scenarios, and tasks. \n",
