    "Data transformation is the process of converting raw data into a structured format suitable for analysis or model training. It includes tasks like cleaning data (removing duplicates and handling missing values), normalizing values, encoding categorical variables, and merging data from different sources. This ensures the data is in a consistent, usable state for the model. \n",

    "In the Gen AI Lifecycle (Saltz, 2024) Data preparation is vital because it directly impacts the accuracy and performance of AI models. Well-prepared data reduces noise, ensures consistency, and helps models focus on relevant patterns. It also speeds up processing by eliminating unnecessary complexity, ultimately leading to more reliable and efficient outcomes."
