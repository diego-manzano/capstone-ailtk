    ">\n",
    "> CoffeePro’s virtual coffee concierge is now live and assisting users with personalized coffee recommendations. However, launching the virtual agent is just the beginning—ensuring its continuous improvement based on real user interactions is crucial. As users engage with the AI, their feedback, ratings, and behavioral data provide valuable insights into the assistant’s effectiveness, accuracy, and user satisfaction.\n",
    "> \n",
    "> As the AI developer, your task is to implement a monitoring system that collects and analyzes feedback, allowing you to refine the virtual agent’s performance over time. This includes tracking response accuracy, identifying patterns in user satisfaction, and leveraging Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhancements to improve recommendations. Additionally, the system should detect recurring issues, such as misinterpretations, biases, or inadequate responses, and provide mechanisms for updating the model accordingly.\n",

    "> (a) Analyze feedback data \n",
    "Develop a structured approach to evaluate feedback trends, detect areas for improvement, and update the knowledge base accordingly.\n",
    "> \n",
    "> (b) Refine model performance\n",
    "Utilize insights from user ratings and comments to enhance response accuracy, personalize recommendations, and optimize the virtual agent’s conversational experience.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> By the end of this activity, you will have gained practical experience in monitoring AI performance, analyzing user feedback, and implementing continuous improvements to ensure CoffeePro’s virtual agent remains effective, reliable, and user-friendly."
