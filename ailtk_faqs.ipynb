    "### COMMON ISSUES / TROUBLESHOOTING\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Issue 1: Virtual Machine is Slow or Unresponsive\n",
    "✔ **Solution:** Increase allocated RAM and CPU cores in VMware settings.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Issue 2: MySQL Fails to Start\n",
    "✔ **Solution:** Open Terminal and run:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "sudo service mysql restart\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Issue 3: Toolkit Launcher Doesn't Open\n",
    "✔ Solution: Manually start the toolkit from Terminal:\n",
    "\n",
    "Bash\n",
    "\n",
    "cd ~/ailtk_launcher\n",
    "conda activate ailtk-env\n",
    "voila\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Issue 4: Google Gemini API or Key Not Working\n",
    "✔ Solution: Ensure the key is active in Google Cloud Console. Refer to the Google Gemini Developer API.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Issue 5: Running Python in VSCode results in an error stating “Missing Dependency”\n",
    "✔ Solution: Install the missing package using Conda or Pip depending on the package. Also, refer to the requirements.yml file in the root folder of the toolkit (~/capstone-ailtk).\n",
    "\n",
    "Using Conda:\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "\n",
    "Bash\n",
    "\n",
    "conda activate ailtk-env\n",
    "conda install <missing-package-name>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Using Pip:\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "\n",
    "Bash\n",
    "\n",
    "conda activate ailtk-env\n",
    "pip install <missing-package-name>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Updating from requirements.yml:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "\n",
    "cd ~/capstone-ailtk\n",
    "conda activate ailtk-env\n",
    "conda env update --name ailtk-env --file requirements.yml --prune\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Issue 6: Conda Virtual Environment (ailtk-env) returns an error in VSCode and fails to start.\n",
    "✔ Solution: Restart the terminal instance and enter:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "Bash\n",
    "\n",

    "### FAQs\n",
    "Q1: How long does the toolkit take to load?\n",
    "A: The initial load may take 3-5 minutes due to caching and resource allocation. Subsequent loads are faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2: Can I use my existing Python environment?\n",
    "A: No. Use the pre-configured environment inside the virtual machine to avoid compatibility issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3: What if my VMware doesn't support the virtual machine?\n",
    "A: Ensure virtualization is enabled in BIOS and you are using a compatible VMware version.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4: How do I reset the toolkit if I encounter persistent issues?\n",
    "A: Reboot the virtual machine and delete temporary files in the /tmp/ directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5: Is there a way to access the toolkit without VMware?\n",
    "A: Currently, the toolkit is only available through the virtual machine. A web-based version is in development.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q6: Where can I find additional learning resources?\n",
    "A: Check the Viola Home tab and the Resources folder on the virtual machine’s desktop."
