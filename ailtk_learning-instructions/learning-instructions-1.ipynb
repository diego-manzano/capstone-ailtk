    "> You've recently been hired by CoffeePro as an AI developer. Your task is to create a virtual agent capable of revolutionizing the customer coffee-buying experience. By analyzing user inputs, the agent should provide tailored recommendations for the perfect coffee blend based on the given parameters, ensuring customers discover new favorites that align with their unique tastes and needs. The resulting agent should offer tailored recommendations, helping customers discover new coffee beans that align perfectly with their individual tastes and needs.\n",
