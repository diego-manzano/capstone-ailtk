    "#### **Case Scenario:**\n",
    "\n",
    "> With your exploratory data analysis (EDA) from Activity 2 complete, Welp now requires the transformation of the analyzed data into a format suitable for the AI-powered virtual assistant. Management envisions a virtual agent capable of personalized restaurant recommendations, and this step is crucial to ensure the data is usable for the virtual assistant’s recommendation engine.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Your role as an AI developer is to process and structure the dataset in a way that it can be effectively utilized by the virtual assistant. This includes transforming the raw data from the Yelp dataset into a format that captures essential features such as restaurant names, cuisine types, user ratings, review highlights, ambiance descriptions, and other relevant data, while ensuring compatibility with the AI system's needs.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> The transformation process will require you to clean the data, handle missing values, and organize the dataset in a way that the AI virtual assistant can access and interpret easily. The dataset should be formatted to allow the assistant to:\n",
    "> - Filter restaurants based on user preferences such as cuisine type, dietary restrictions, location, ambiance, and more.\n",
    "> - Provide detailed restaurant information including user reviews and highlights, to enhance the personalized recommendations.\n",
    "> - Offer recommendations that prioritize the most relevant and trusted data based on the user’s historical preferences and current inputs.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Management has specifically requested the output to include:\n",
    "> - Cleaned and structured data, with features like cuisine type, location, and ambiance clearly labeled and formatted.\n",
    "> - An enriched dataset that includes not only basic restaurant information but also sentiment analysis or summary statistics derived from user reviews.\n",
    "> - A consistent structure suitable for easy integration into the virtual assistant system, with the possibility to be expanded as the project grows.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Your tasks are as follows:\n",
    ">\n",
    "> (a) **Identify the features and attributes that need to be included in the dataset for use by the virtual assistant.** These features should directly support the AI’s ability to provide personalized recommendations.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> (b) **Process and clean the data**, ensuring that it is in a structured and consistent format. Handle any missing or incomplete information, normalize textual data, and prepare the dataset for AI consumption.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> (c) **Prepare the dataset for integration with the virtual assistant**, ensuring that the dataset format is compatible with machine learning models and can be easily accessed by the recommendation engine. Export the dataset into a file format suitable for training and real-time recommendation (e.g., CSV, Excel).\n",
    ">\n",
    "> By completing these tasks, you will gain hands-on experience in data preprocessing, cleaning, and structuring data for AI-based systems, preparing the dataset for deployment in a personalized recommendation system.\n"
