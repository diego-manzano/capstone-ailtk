    "> Welp's restaurant recommendation virtual assistant has now progressed to the evaluation phase, where its capabilities and safety must be thoroughly tested to ensure it meets real-world demands and adheres to ethical AI guidelines. With its Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system integrated, the assistant can provide personalized restaurant suggestions and contextual justifications. However, it is essential to confirm that these recommendations are accurate, inclusive, and aligned with user expectations.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> As the AI developer, your task is to evaluate the assistant’s performance across various use cases. This includes testing its ability to handle diverse user inputs—ranging from vague or incomplete queries to specific and detailed requests. Additionally, you must assess the assistant's adherence to ethical AI principles, such as avoiding biased or discriminatory suggestions, and ensuring that its responses remain neutral and user-focused.\n",
    ">\n",

Additionally, ensure that its recommendations remain respectful and appropriate for diverse cultural contexts.\n",
