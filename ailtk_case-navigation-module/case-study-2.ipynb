    "#### Case Scenario\n",
    "\n",
    "> Management has tasked you, an AI developer, with building an AI-powered virtual assistant that can provide users with highly personalized restaurant recommendations. This virtual assistant will filter restaurant suggestions based on user inputs such as:\n",
    ">   - Cuisine Preferences: e.g., Italian, Vegan, Asian fusion.\n",
    ">   - Dietary Restrictions: e.g., Gluten-free, Halal, Keto.\n",
    ">   - Location: Proximity-based recommendations based on user location or specified address.\n",
    ">   - Ambiance: e.g., Casual, Fine dining, Family-friendly, Romantic.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Data Sourcing and Investigation\n",
    "> To successfully develop this virtual assistant, you are required to source and investigate usable data from the available dataset. You are given access to the Welp Dataset, a detailed collection of restaurant information, reviews, ratings, cuisine types, and more.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> You will begin by sourcing restaurants and reviewing data from the given dataset. The output dataset would include columns like:\n",
    "> - Restaurant Name\n",
    "> - Cuisine Type\n",
    "> - Location\n",
    "> - User Ratings\n",
    "> - Review Highlights\n",
    "> - Ambiance Descriptions\n",
    "> - Price Range\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Your task is to **perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the datasource provided here to get an initial understanding on the dataset provided and how you can use the information within in the later chapters.\n",
